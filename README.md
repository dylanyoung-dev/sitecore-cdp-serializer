[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sitecore-cdp-serializer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/sitecore-cdp-serializer)

## Installation

Sitecore CDP serializer requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 14 or above. To install, run the following commands from any directory in your terminal:

```bash
npm install sitecore-cdp-serializer -g
```

When using the CLI in a CI environment we recommend installing it locally as a development dependency, instead of globally. To install locally, run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
npx install --save-dev sitecore-cdp-serializer
```

**Important:** Running `npm install sitecore-cdp-serializer -g` in CI means you're always installing the latest version of the tool, including breaking changes. When you install locally and use a [lock file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci) you guarantee reproducible builds.
